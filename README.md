# The Hypertext Library

See this website in action [here](http://hypertextlibrary.com/ "The Hypertext Library")


## Our Mission

Our website is devoted to the idea that 
literature can be analyzed in a hypertextual manner. 
A certain word or phrase may appear several times for a given book, and we believe there is 
meaning embedded in the links between the occurrences. The Hypertext Library allows you to treat a book 
like a brain, with synaptic connections from word to word, strengthening the meaning behind 
the text.

## How to Request a Book

If there is a book you would like to see added to the website, shoot me an email (ncteisen@umich.edu) with a link to the
text from the book. The book must be in the public domain in order to be added to this website. 
[Project Gutenberg] (https://www.gutenberg.org/ "Project Gutenberg") is a great place to find books that are
availible to be added to the library.
